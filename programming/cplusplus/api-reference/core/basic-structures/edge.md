# CEdge

CEdge is a structure composed of two Corner points in an image. A Corner represents a point at which the image's brightness or color sharply changes. Therefore, a CEdge is a line segment connecting two such points that have been identified as Corners.

class dynamsoft::basic_structures::CEdge
