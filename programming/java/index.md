# Introduction to Dynamsoft Capture Vision Java Edition

Dynamsoft Capture Vision (DCV) Java Edition enables you to develop highly customizable applications for barcode reading, label recognition, document border detection, and result parsing with Java.

Dynamsoft Capture Vision Bundle is an aggregating SDK of a series of specific functional products including:

- Dynamsoft Barcode Reader (DBR): enables users to quickly deploy barcode scanning functionality on all common barcodes such as 1D, QR, PDF417, etc.

- Dynamsoft Label Recognizer (DLR): recognizes meaningful zonal text or symbols within an image, commonly referred to as a "Label" in this context.

- Dynamsoft Document Normalizer (DDN): detects quadrilaterals (or "quads") in images, such as document or table boundaries, and then perform document normalization on the images within those detected quads.

- Dynamsoft Code Parser (DCP): extracts meaningful fields from text/bytes into human-readable information, typically used for post-processing results generated by DBR/DLR.

### System Requirements

- Operating systems:
  - Windows Windows: Windows 8 and higher, or Windows Server 2012 and higher
  - Linux x64 (Ubuntu 14.04.4+ LTS, Debian 8+, CentOS 7+, etc.)
  - Linux arm 64bit
  - macOS universal 10.15+
- JDK 1.8 and above

- For Embedded Devices:
For embedded or ARM-based platforms, we recommend using a device with performance equivalent to or better than a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4GB RAM). Minimum recommended specs:
  - Quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 processor (or equivalent)
  - 4 GB RAM
  - Linux-based OS (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu Server)
