# Enumeration ImagePixelFormat

`ImagePixelFormat` defines the range of pixel formats that an image can have, specifying how color and transparency data are represented in each pixel of the image.

```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)
public @interface EnumImagePixelFormat {
    //0:Black, 1:White 
    int IPF_BINARY = 0;
    //0:White, 1:Black 
    int IPF_BINARYINVERTED = 1;
    //8bit gray 
    int IPF_GRAYSCALED = 2;
    //NV21 
    int IPF_NV21 = 3;
    //16bit with RGB channel order stored in memory from high to low address
    int IPF_RGB_565 = 4;
    //16bit with RGB channel order stored in memory from high to low address
    int IPF_RGB_555 = 5;
    //24bit with RGB channel order stored in memory from high to low address
    int IPF_RGB_888 = 6;
    //32bit with ARGB channel order stored in memory from high to low address
    int IPF_ARGB_8888 = 7;
    //48bit with RGB channel order stored in memory from high to low address
    int IPF_RGB_161616 = 8;
    //64bit with ARGB channel order stored in memory from high to low address
    int IPF_ARGB_16161616 = 9;
    //32bit with ABGR channel order stored in memory from high to low address
    int IPF_ABGR_8888 = 10;
    //64bit with ABGR channel order stored in memory from high to low address
    int IPF_ABGR_16161616 = 11;
    //24bit with BGR channel order stored in memory from high to low address
    int IPF_BGR_888 = 12;
    //0:Black, 255:White
    int IPF_BINARY_8 = 13;
    //NV12
    int IPF_NV12 = 14;
    //0:White, 255:Black (inverted binary 8-bit)
    int IPF_BINARY_8_INVERTED = 15;
