# Enumeration SectionType

`SectionType` categorizes the distinct segments within the image processing algorithm, pinpointing the exact phase responsible for generating a specific `IntermediateResult`.

```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)
public @interface EnumSectionType {
    //No section type is specified.
    int ST_NULL = 0;
    //The result is output by "region prediction" section.
    int ST_REGION_PREDETECTION = 1;
    //The result is output by "barcode localization" section.
    int ST_BARCODE_LOCALIZATION = 2;
    //The result is output by "barcode decoding" section.
    int ST_BARCODE_DECODING = 3;
    //The result is output by "text line localization" section.
    int ST_TEXT_LINE_LOCALIZATION = 4;
    //The result is output by "text line recognition" section.
    int ST_TEXT_LINE_RECOGNITION = 5;
    //The result is output by "document detection" section.
    int ST_DOCUMENT_DETECTION = 6;
    //The result is output by "document deskewing" section.
    int ST_DOCUMENT_DESKEWING = 7;
    //The result is output by "image enhancement" section.
    int ST_IMAGE_ENHANCEMENT = 8;
}
