# Release Notes for Java Edition - 3.x

## 3.2.1000 (10/14/2025)

### ðŸŽ‰Milestone Release
Version 3.2.1000 introduces a series of AI-driven improvements designed to enhance barcode and MRZ detection accuracy, processing speed, and configuration flexibility.

This release focuses on practical performance gains for production environments across retail, logistics, manufacturing, and identity verification workflows.

### âœ¨ Key Highlights
#### AI-Powered Barcode Detection and Decoding

- New Localization Models â€“ Introduces [`OneDLocalization`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/localization-modes.html#modelnamearray) and [`DataMatrixQRCodeLocalization`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/localization-modes.html#modelnamearray) neural network models for improved detection of **blurred / low-resolution 1D codes**, or **partially damaged DataMatrix/QR codes**.
- Specialized Decoders â€“ Adds [`EAN13Decoder`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html#modelnamearray) and [`Code128Decoder`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html#modelnamearray) models optimized for **long-distance** and **motion-blurred** decoding scenarios.
- Redesigned Deblur Model â€“ The [`OneDDeblur`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html#modelnamearray) model now provides more effective recovery from **motion and focus blur**.
- Configurable Model Selection â€“ The new `ModelNameArray` parameter supports flexible model loading and fine-grained control for specific barcode types.

#### Precision and Processing Control

- Enhanced Deblur Methods â€“ [`DM_DEEP_ANALYSIS`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html#dm_deep_analysis) now includes sub-level control with `OneDGeneral`, `TwoDGeneral`, and `EAN13Enhanced` options.
- Barcode Count Expectation â€“ The new [`ExpectedBarcodesCount`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-format-specification/expected-barcodes-count.html) parameter enables **format-specific quantity control** and **early termination** in fixed-count workflows.
- Improved Region Detection â€“ The new [`RPM_GRAY_CONSISTENCY`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}image-parameter/region-predetection-modes.html#rpm_gray_consistency) mode provides more precise region extraction based on **grayscale uniformity** and **local consistency** for document and label processing.

#### AI-Powered MRZ Detection

- Neural MRZ Localization â€“ The new [`MRZLocalization`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}label-recognizer-task-settings/localization-modes.html#modelnamearray) model improves region detection accuracy and delivers up to **42.7%** faster processing for MRZ-based document workflows.
- Configurable Localization Control â€“ The new [`LocalizationModes`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}label-recognizer-task-settings/localization-modes.html) parameter allows configuration for text line detection.

#### Smart Document Capture

- Clarity-Based Frame Selection â€“ Automatically selects the sharpest and highest-quality frame in live capture workflows.
- Cross-Frame Verification â€“ Updated verification algorithms enhance result reliability.

### Performance Highlights

#### Barcode Workflows

- Up to **26.5%** higher read rates under blur conditions with as much as **44%** faster processing.
- Reliable decoding of DataMatrix and QR codes with missing or damaged finder patterns.
- Extended operational range beyond 75 cm for long-distance barcode scanning.

#### Document Workflows

- Improved performance in live video capture environments.
- Consistent document quality through clarity-based frame evaluation.
- Faster MRZ processing for high-throughput identity verification

### Developer Notes

- Backward Compatibility â€“ Fully compatible with existing integrations; no code-level changes required for upgrade.
- Configuration Flexibility â€“ Expanded parameter set allows comprehensive model configuration for scenario-specific tuning.
- Production Stability â€“ All new models validated in enterprise environments.

### Changed

#### Parameter Defaults

- [`MaxThreadsInOneTask`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/max-threads-in-one-task.html): default changed from 4 â†’ 0 (auto-detection).
- [`IncludeTrailingCheckDigit`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-format-specification/include-trailing-check-digit.html): default changed from 1 â†’ 0. Code128 results will no longer include the trailing check digit by default for improved compliance with standard decoding practices.

### Deprecations

- `DeblurModelNameArray` argument of [`DeblurModes`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html) â†’ use `ModelNameArray`.
- `AppendModelBuffer` method of `CaptureVisionRouter` â†’ use [`AppendDLModelBuffer`]({{ site.dcvb_java_api }}capture-vision-router/auxiliary-methods.html#appenddlmodelbuffer).

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash issue that occurred when calling `initLicense`.

## 3.0.6100 (08/19/2025)

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where using a callback function could cause the program to crash.

## 3.0.6000 (08/06/2025)
