**For Document Processing Applications**
- **Real-time video streams**: Optimized performance maintains smooth user experience in live capture scenarios
- **Document quality assessment**: Intelligent clarity-based frame selection ensures highest quality document captures

**For Enterprise Integration**
- **Retail environments**: Enhanced performance for blurred handheld scanning and long-distance shelf reading
- **Logistics & shipping**: Improved recognition for package tracking with better blur and long-distance scanning capabilities
- **Manufacturing QC**: Improved 2D code reading on printed/etched parts with wear damage  
- **Security applications**: Faster MRZ processing for high-throughput identity verification

**For Developers**
- **Backward Compatible**: Seamless upgrade with existing code and easy migration path
- **Flexible Configuration**: Extensive parameter customization for specific use cases and comprehensive model configuration options
- **Enterprise Ready**: Battle-tested stability for production environments

### Changed

- Updated the default value of parameter [`MaxThreadsInOneTask`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/max-threads-in-one-task.html) from 4 to 0 (auto-detection).
- Updated the default value of parameter [`IncludeTrailingCheckDigit`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-format-specification/include-trailing-check-digit.html) from 1 to 0. This means Code128 barcode results will no longer include the trailing check digit in the decoded bytes by default, improving compatibility with industry standards.
- Deprecated argument `DeblurModelNameArray` of parameter [`DeblurModes`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html), use `ModelNameArray` instead.
- Deprecated method `append_model_buffer` of class [`CaptureVisionRouter`]({{ site.dcvb_python_api }}capture-vision-router/capture-vision-router.html), use [`append_dl_model_buffer`]({{ site.dcvb_python_api }}capture-vision-router/auxiliary-methods.html#append_dl_model_buffer) instead.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where accessing `Quadrilateral.points` directly would return random values instead of the expected coordinate points.

## 3.0.6000 (08/06/2025)

### Changed

- `start_capturing` now stops immediately and returns a license-related error code if none of the tasks have a valid license, instead of proceeding and returning an empty result.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused a crash when using a specific type of license.
- Fixed various minor bugs and improved overall stability.


## 3.0.4100 (07/16/2025)

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused a crash when calling the `get_processed_document_result` method of `CapturedResult`.


## 3.0.4000 (07/15/2025)

### New

- **Tile-Based TIFF Image Support**: Added support for TIFF images with tile-based storage format.

- **Template Version Validation**: Introduced version checking for templates to prevent compatibility issues and mismatches.

### Improved

- **White-on-White Document Recognition**: Optimized accuracy for document detection in scenarios where white paper is placed on a white background.

### Changed

- **License Validation Behavior**: Instead of stopping execution immediately on an invalid license module, the library now continues processing and returns results from modules with valid licenses. An error is still reported to indicate the license issue.

- **PDFR License Control Removal**: Removed the license check for the PDFR module.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the `get_detected_quad_result_items` method of `ProcessedDocumentResult` returned items of the wrong type.
- Fixed various minor bugs and improved overall stability.

## 3.0.3000 (05/15/2025)

### New

- Added support for appending pages to PDF files generated by `ImageIO.save_to_file`. Appending to other PDF files is not supported.
- Added new property [codewords]({{ site.dbr_python_api }}pdf417-details.html#codewords) to the `PDF417Details` class.

### Fixed

- Resolved a performance issue that could cause unusually high CPU and memory usage in some cases.

### Changed

- Removed the licensing requirement for saving PDFs.
