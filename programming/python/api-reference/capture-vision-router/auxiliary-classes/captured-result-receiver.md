# CapturedResultReceiver

The `CapturedResultReceiver` class is responsible for receiving captured results. It contains several callback functions for different types of results, including original image, decoded barcodes, recognized text lines, detected quads, normalized images, and parsed results.

>Note: Subclasses inheriting from this class must ensure that the parent class constructor (`super().__init__()`) is properly called to guarantee correct initialization.

## Definition

*Module:* dynamsoft_capture_vision_router

```python
class CapturedResultReceiver
```

### on_captured_result_received

Callback function triggered after processing each image and returns all captured results.

```python
def on_captured_result_received(self, result: CapturedResult) -> None:
```

**Parameters**

`result` The captured result.

### on_original_image_result_received

Callback function triggered when start processing each image and returns the original image result. For the callback to be triggered, it is essential that the parameter `OutputOriginalImage` is set to value `1`.

```python
def on_original_image_result_received(self, result: OriginalImageResultItem) -> None:
```

**Parameters**

`result` The original image result.

### on_decoded_barcodes_received

Callback function triggered after processing each image and returns all decoded barcodes. For the callback to be triggered, it is essential that the `BarcodeReaderTask` is properly configured.

```python
def on_decoded_barcodes_received(self, result: "DecodedBarcodesResult") -> None:
```

**Parameters**

`result` The decoded barcodes result.

**See Also**

### on_recognized_text_lines_received

Callback function triggered after processing each image and returns all recognized text lines. For the callback to be triggered, it is essential that the `LabelRecognizerTask` is properly configured.

```python
def on_recognized_text_lines_received(self, result: "RecognizedTextLinesResult") -> None:
```

**Parameters**

`result` The recognized text lines result.

**See Also**

[RecognizedTextLinesResult]({{ site.dlr_python_api }}recognized-text-lines-result.html)

### on_processed_document_result_received

Callback function triggered after processing each image and returns all processed document results. For the callback to be triggered, it is essential that the `DocumentNormalizerTask` is properly configured.

```python
def on_processed_document_result_received(self, result: "ProcessedDocumentResult") -> None:
```

**Parameters**

`result` The processed document results.

**See Also**

[ProcessedDocumentResult]({{ site.ddn_python_api }}processed-document-result.html)

### on_parsed_results_received

Callback function triggered after processing each image and returns all parsed results. For the callback to be triggered, it is essential that the `CodeParserTask` is properly configured.

```python
def on_parsed_results_received(self, result: "ParsedResult") -> None:
```

**Parameters**

`result` The parsed result.

**See Also**

[ParsedResult]({{ site.dcp_python_api }}parsed-result.html)

### get_name

Gets the name of the captured result receiver.  

```python
def get_name(self) -> str:
```

**Return Value**

Returns the name of the captured result receiver.  

### set_name

Sets the name of the captured result receiver.  

```python
def set_name(self, name: str) -> None:
```

**Parameters**

`name` The name of the captured result receiver.
