# Release Notes for .NET Edition - 3.x

## 3.0.4000 (07/15/2025)

### New

- **Tile-Based TIFF Image Support**: Added support for TIFF images with tile-based storage format.

- **Base64 String Conversion**: Enabled bidirectional conversion between `ImageData` and Base64 strings.

- **Template Version Validation**: Introduced version checking for templates to prevent compatibility issues and mismatches.

### Improved

- **White-on-White Document Recognition**: Optimized accuracy for document detection in scenarios where white paper is placed on a white background.

### Changed

- **License Validation Behavior**: Instead of stopping execution immediately on an invalid license module, the library now continues processing and returns results from modules with valid licenses. An error is still reported to indicate the license issue.

- **PDFR License Control Removal**: Removed the license check for the PDFR module.

- **Property Renamed in `PDFReadingParameter`**: The property `dip` has been renamed to `dpi` to fix a naming error.

### Fixed

- Fixed various minor bugs and improved overall stability.

## 3.0.3000 (05/13/2025)

### [Highlights](https://www.dynamsoft.com/release-highlights/?product=dcv3.0)

- Workflow Improvements
  - Restructured the parameter control hierarchy at all levels for finer scope definition and more granular process management, with the stage level newly added.
  - Enabled custom combinations and sequences of sections, increasing flexibility and operational customization under specific conditions.
  - Redesigned document normalization sections to better accommodate diverse document processing operations.
  
- Deep Learning Integration
  - Improved the reading rate of 1D barcode by introducing a new deblurring deep-learning model.
  - Enhanced text recognition capabilities with deep learning-based text-line recognition.

- Algorithm Enhancements
  - Enabled deduplication at the Region of Interest (ROI) level to consolidate results from multiple tasks.
  - Enhanced the text recognition workflow by integrating improved multi-step recognition processes and validation methods.
  - Improved the CODE_128 and DataMatrix DeepAnalysis algorithms for better decoding accuracy and performance.
  - Added support for new barcode types: CODE_32, MATRIX_25, KIX, and TELEPEN.
  - Added GS1 Application Identifiers (AI) support for improved code parsing capabilities.

- Engineering Optimizations
  - Unified template-loading logic to reduce I/O overhead.
  - Added support for capturing data from multi-page files, including PDF and TIFF formats.
  - Implemented conversion functionality between `ImageData` and image files, including both on-disk and in-memory files.
